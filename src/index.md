# Okiedokie artichokey

Hi,

I'm using this as a place to tinker with AI tools and learn some javascript, and also maybe as a portfolio. Everything's a work in progress or testing, unless you think it's awesome.

Things I need to do:
1. Tableau ex.
2. PBI ex.
3. explore proof of concept for modular calc (add some selector to the calc to select for credit card, mortgage (with amort table, taxes, buy v rent, etc.))
4. determine what i'm actually doing with this page
5. figure out what makes sense to do on this page in particular. To do list is.. not it.
6. automate dupe to other site
7. clean up the comments


Things I did:
1. brief calc writeup, link, explanation vid
2. fix font
3. cleanup pages
4. dupe to other site
